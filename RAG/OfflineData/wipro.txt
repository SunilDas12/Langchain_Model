Wipro Limited is a leading global information technology, consulting, and business process services company. It was founded on 29 December 1945 by Mohamed Premji, originally as Western India Palm Refined Oils Limited, a manufacturer of vegetable oils in Amalner, Maharashtra. Over the decades, under the visionary leadership of Azim Premji, the company gradually diversified into various industries, including consumer care, engineering, and most significantly, information technology. By the 1980s, Wipro had shifted its primary focus to IT services, establishing itself as one of India’s top technology firms.

Headquartered in Bangalore, Karnataka, Wipro has expanded its presence across more than 60 countries, employing over 240,000 professionals worldwide. It is publicly listed on the Bombay Stock Exchange, National Stock Exchange, and also on the New York Stock Exchange, making it a truly global enterprise. The company operates through major business segments such as IT Services, IT Products, and Business Process Services, offering solutions across industries like banking, healthcare, energy, manufacturing, and retail. With expertise in cloud services, artificial intelligence, data analytics, and cybersecurity, Wipro continues to support digital transformation for businesses worldwide.

To strengthen its portfolio, Wipro has acquired several companies, including Appirio in 2016 and Capco in 2021, which significantly expanded its capabilities in cloud solutions and financial services. The company is also recognized for its sustainability initiatives and has been consistently ranked in the Dow Jones Sustainability Index. Through corporate social responsibility, Wipro invests in education, healthcare, and environmental sustainability. Its flagship program, Wipro Earthian, promotes sustainability education in schools and colleges, while the Azim Premji Foundation focuses on improving the quality of education in India.

Apart from IT services, Wipro also operates in other sectors. Wipro Consumer Care produces popular products like Santoor soap, while Wipro Lighting delivers smart and energy-efficient solutions. Wipro Infrastructure Engineering works in hydraulics and aerospace, further diversifying the company’s reach.

Azim Premji, the former chairman, is often called the “Czar of the Indian IT Industry” and is globally admired for his philanthropy, having donated a significant portion of his wealth to charitable causes. Today, under the leadership of Thierry Delaporte, Wipro continues to focus on innovation, investing heavily in AI, automation, and design-led experiences through its global design studio, Designit. With partnerships with leading cloud providers such as Microsoft, AWS, and Google Cloud, and recognition in Gartner’s Magic Quadrant, Wipro stands as a symbol of India’s rise in the global IT sector, blending technology, sustainability, and social responsibility.
