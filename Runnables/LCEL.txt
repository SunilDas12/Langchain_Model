LCEL (LangChain Expression Language)

Is a declarative way to build chains in LangChain.
Instead of writing a lot of procedural code, you can compose prompts, models, and parsers using the | (pipe) operator.

Why LCEL?

Readable → Chains look like a flow of data.
Composable → You can easily swap or extend components.
Efficient → Handles streaming, async, and batching automatically.


# LCEL chain
chain = prompt | model | parser
